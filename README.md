# Machine_Learning_Projects

I put all my Machine_Learning_Projects in this file.





## ðŸ”— I categorized  them by each different purpose:
[![01-Finance Project -](https://img.shields.io/badge/project-01--Finance%20Project-red)](https://github.com/Matt-Chang/Machine_Learning_Projects/blob/main/01-Finance%20Project%20-%20Solutions.ipynb)

In this data project, I will focus on exploratory data analysis of stock prices.


[![02-Python_API_Project-](https://img.shields.io/badge/project-02--%20Python__API__Project-red)](https://github.com/Matt-Chang/Machine_Learning_Projects/blob/main/02_Python_API_Project.ipynb)

In this data project, I use python to automatically get the API from CoinMarketCap.


[![03-Linear Regression-](https://img.shields.io/badge/project-03--Linear%20Regression-red)](https://github.com/Matt-Chang/Machine_Learning_Projects/blob/main/03-Linear%20Regression%20Project.ipynb)

In this data project, I carefully followed the instructions by DataScience Bootcamp to prove my ability to solve real-world machine learning problems.


[![04 - Logistic Regression with Python-](https://img.shields.io/badge/project-04%20--%20Logistic%20Regression%20with%20Python-red)](https://github.com/Matt-Chang/Machine_Learning_Projects/blob/main/04%20-%20Logistic%20Regression%20with%20Python.ipynb)

I used the famous data titanic from Kaggle to predict the survival rate among other factors like class, age ,or fare.


[![05 - Logistic Regression Project2 -](https://img.shields.io/badge/project-05--Logistic%20Regression%20Project2-red)](https://github.com/Matt-Chang/Machine_Learning_Projects/blob/main/05-Logistic%20Regression%20Project%20-%20Solutions.ipynb)

In this project I will be working with a fake advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement on a company website.I will try to create a model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.


[![06 - K Nearest Neighbors Project -](https://img.shields.io/badge/project-06--K%20Nearest%20Neighbors-red)](https://github.com/Matt-Chang/Machine_Learning_Projects/blob/main/06-K%20Nearest%20Neighbors%20with%20Python.ipynb)

Here, I 'll try to use KNN to create a model that directly predicts a class for a new data point based off of the features.

[![06-2 - K Nearest Neighbors Project2 -](https://img.shields.io/badge/project-06--2--K%20Nearest%20Neighbors%20Project-red)](https://github.com/Matt-Chang/Machine_Learning_Projects/blob/main/06-2-K%20Nearest%20Neighbors%20Project.ipynb)

In this data project, I carefully followed the instructions by DataScience Bootcamp to prove my ability to solve real-world K Nearest Neighbors Project.

[![07 - 07-Decision Trees and Random Forests -](https://img.shields.io/badge/project-07--Decision%20Trees%20and%20Random%20Forests-red)](https://github.com/Matt-Chang/Machine_Learning_Projects/blob/main/07-Decision%20Trees%20and%20Random%20Forests%20in%20Python.ipynb)

Based on the data set kyphosis, I used simple Decision Trees and Random Forests to predict the result.
