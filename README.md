I used the famous data titanic from Kaggle to predict the survival rate among other factors like class, age ,or fare.


[![05 - Logistic Regression Project2 -](https://img.shields.io/badge/project-05--Logistic%20Regression%20Project2-red)](https://github.com/Matt-Chang/Machine_Learning_Projects/blob/main/05-Logistic%20Regression%20Project%20-%20Solutions.ipynb)

In this project I will be working with a fake advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement on a company website.I will try to create a model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.


[![06 - K Nearest Neighbors Project -](https://img.shields.io/badge/project-06--K%20Nearest%20Neighbors-red)](https://github.com/Matt-Chang/Machine_Learning_Projects/blob/main/06-K%20Nearest%20Neighbors%20with%20Python.ipynb)

Here, I 'll try to use KNN to create a model that directly predicts a class for a new data point based off of the features.

[![06-2 - K Nearest Neighbors Project2 -](https://img.shields.io/badge/project-06--2--K%20Nearest%20Neighbors%20Project-red)](https://github.com/Matt-Chang/Machine_Learning_Projects/blob/main/06-2-K%20Nearest%20Neighbors%20Project.ipynb)

In this data project, I carefully followed the instructions by DataScience Bootcamp to prove my ability to solve real-world K Nearest Neighbors Project.

[![07 -Decision Trees and Random Forests -](https://img.shields.io/badge/project-07--Decision%20Trees%20and%20Random%20Forests-red)](https://github.com/Matt-Chang/Machine_Learning_Projects/blob/main/07-Decision%20Trees%20and%20Random%20Forests%20in%20Python.ipynb)

Based on the data set kyphosis, I used simple Decision Trees and Random Forests to predict the result.

[![07-02 -Decision Trees and Random Forests -](https://img.shields.io/badge/project-07--2--Decision%20Trees%20and%20Random%20Forest-red)](https://github.com/Matt-Chang/Machine_Learning_Projects/blob/main/07-2-Decision%20Trees%20and%20Random%20Forest%20Project.ipynb)

For this project we will be exploring publicly available data from LendingClub. I will try to predict the high probability of paying the money back.

[![08-Support Vector Machines with Python-](https://img.shields.io/badge/project-08--Support%20Vector%20Machines%20with%20Python-red)](https://github.com/Matt-Chang/Machine_Learning_Projects/blob/main/08-Support%20Vector%20Machines%20with%20Python.ipynb)

I used Support Vector Machines to predict the probability of breast cancer.

[![08-02-Support Vector Machines Project-](https://img.shields.io/badge/project-08--02--Support%20Vector%20Machines%20Project-red)](https://github.com/Matt-Chang/Machine_Learning_Projects/blob/main/08-02-Support%20Vector%20Machines%20Project.ipynb)

For this series of projects, I will be using the famous Iris flower data set to practice Support Vector Machines.


[![09-01-K Means Clustering with Python-](https://img.shields.io/badge/project-09--01--K%20Means%20Clustering%20with%20Python-red)](https://github.com/Matt-Chang/Machine_Learning_Projects/blob/main/09-01-K%20Means%20Clustering%20with%20Python..ipynb)

1 - K Means Clustering practice.

[![09-02-K Means Clustering with Python-](https://img.shields.io/badge/project-09--02--K%20Means%20Clustering-red)](https://github.com/Matt-Chang/Machine_Learning_Projects/blob/main/09-02-K%20Means%20Clustering%20Project.ipynb)

In this project, I will use the dataset, College_Data, to implement Means Clustering.

[![10-Principal Component Analysis-](https://img.shields.io/badge/project-010--Principal%20Component%20Analysis-red)](https://github.com/Matt-Chang/Machine_Learning_Projects/blob/main/010-Principal%20Component%20Analysis.ipynb)

I used Principal Component Analysis on the dataset,breast cancer, to see correlation between the various feature and the principal component itself.


[![11 -Recommender Systems with Python-](https://img.shields.io/badge/project-011--%20Recommender%20Systems%20with%20Python-red)](https://github.com/Matt-Chang/Machine_Learning_Projects/blob/main/011-%20Recommender%20Systems%20with%20Python.ipynb)

In this project, I will develop basic recommendation systems using Python and pandas.
In this notebook, I will focus on providing a basic recommendation system by suggesting items that are most similar to a particular item, in this case, movies.
